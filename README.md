Documenting the nature &amp; depth of art-websites scraped in CommonCrawl

## The modern artist and the plumage paradox

**Ansatz**: Artists have to make ends meet --> Hence, they need to advertize their art on online art-marrketplaces (irrespective of what medium their art revels in) --> They upload the digital versimiltude of their works --> Web-scraping projects simply _scrape_ away their digital simulacra & feed them into LM training pipelines and claim: I am merely scraping culture
