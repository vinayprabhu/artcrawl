**Ansatz**: 

Artists have to make ends meet &rarr; Hence, they need to advertize their art on online art-marrketplaces (irrespective of what medium their art revels in) &rarr; They upload the digital versimiltude of their works &rarr; Web-scraping projects simply _scrape_ away their digital simulacra & feed them into LM training pipelines and claim: "I am merely scraping culture"
